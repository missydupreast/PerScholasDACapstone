**OVERVIEW**<br>

In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Per Scholas Data Analytics certificate, this capstone project marks the apex of proficiency gained throughout the course and showcases the culmination of acquired knowledge and skills. This project begins with a series of primer activities for the Data Detective Capstone Project and concludes with a larger, more in-depth Data Analytics Capstone Project where I apply the skills learned in a practical setting involving a Credit Card Bank. In this scenario, I have been assigned a series of tasks including extracting credit-card data from json files, transforming and cleaning the data, creating a MySQL database, loading the transformed data into the database, creating a front-end application for bank employees to be able to interact with and modify the data, importing the data into Power BI for analysis and building of visualizations, connecting to a REST API to extract loan application data, loading that data into the credit-card database, providing visualizations and answering questions for the hypothetical business analysis team at the Credit Card Bank. For these tasks I am utilizing Python, Jira, Apache Spark (pyspark), MySQL, and Power BI, and I am sharing my work via github.
